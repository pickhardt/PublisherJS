* Summary *

Publisher lets you hook in to variables with your own subscriber functions, so that your functions can take action before or after the variable is set (or read).  It uses JavaScript getters and setters, and therefore won't work in older browsers.


* Example usage *

<script type="text/javascript" src="publisher.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
  var beforeChange = function(before, after) { console.log("[beforeChange] Changing from " + before + " to " + after);};
  var afterChange = function(before, after) { console.log("[afterChange] Changed from " + before + " to " + after);};
  var beforeSet = function(before, after) { console.log("[beforeSet] Setting from " + before + " to " + after)};
  var afterSet = function(before, after) { console.log("[afterSet] Set from " + before + " to " + after);};
  var onGet = function(value) { console.log("[onGet] Getting value " + value);};
  
  Publisher("x")
    .beforeChange(beforeChange)
    .afterChange(afterChange)
    .beforeSet(beforeSet)
    .afterSet(afterSet)
    .onGet(onGet)
    .set("first");
  
  x;
  x = "second";
  x;
  x = "second";
  x;
  x = "third";
  x;
</script>
